XenonMKV is licensed under the GNU General Public License 2.0 so that I can make use of the already excellent conversion utilities out there already. The relevant license is in gpl.txt. I'd also appreciate an email or website comment if you find this program useful.

This application is written using Visual Basic 2005 and as such, is inherently horrible and a likely example of "worst programming practices". Believe me, I don't publish the source because I'm proud of my code here; it's a program that serves one purpose and one purpose only. My professional work is much better in the event you wish to retain my consulting services. :)

You'll need to reference the #ZipLib library to load this project. It's also available under the GPL.
